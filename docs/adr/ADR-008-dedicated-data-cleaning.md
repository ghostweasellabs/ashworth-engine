# ADR-008: Dedicated Data Cleaning Agent

## Status
Accepted  

## Context
Raw financial data from various sources (PDFs, spreadsheets, bank exports) often contains inconsistencies, formatting issues, and noise that can degrade the quality of downstream analysis and LLM processing. Traditional ETL approaches may not be sufficient for the variety and complexity of financial documents.

## Decision
We will implement a separate `data_cleaner_agent` that operates between data extraction and processing, specifically designed to standardize data and optimize it for LLM consumption.

## Rationale
- **Data Quality**: Ensures consistent, high-quality input for analysis
- **LLM Optimization**: Formats data specifically for better LLM understanding
- **Audit Trail**: Provides clear logging of all cleaning operations
- **Modularity**: Separates concerns between extraction, cleaning, and processing
- **Iterative Improvement**: Can be enhanced based on data quality feedback

## Consequences
### Positive
- Significantly improved data quality and analysis accuracy
- Better LLM performance with clean, standardized input
- Clear audit trail for data transformations
- Reduced errors in downstream processing
- Enables data quality scoring and monitoring

### Negative
- Additional workflow step increases processing time
- More complex error handling and recovery
- Requires careful balance between cleaning and data fidelity
- Additional monitoring and logging requirements

## Implementation
- Create `data_cleaner.py` agent between data_fetcher and data_processor
- Implement standardization rules for common financial data formats  
- Add data quality scoring mechanisms
- Create `data_cleaning_logs` table for audit trail
- Provide LLM-specific formatting optimizations
- Include anomaly detection and flagging

## Cleaning Operations
- **Date Standardization**: Convert various date formats to ISO format
- **Amount Parsing**: Handle currency symbols, thousands separators, negative values
- **Category Normalization**: Standardize account and category names
- **Duplicate Detection**: Identify and handle duplicate transactions
- **Missing Data**: Flag and handle missing required fields
- **Format Optimization**: Structure data for optimal LLM processing

## Quality Metrics
- **Completeness**: Percentage of records with all required fields
- **Consistency**: Standardization of formats across records
- **Accuracy**: Validation against known patterns and rules
- **LLM Readiness**: Formatting optimized for language model processing

## Audit Requirements
- Log all cleaning operations with input/output examples
- Track data quality scores before and after cleaning
- Maintain ability to trace back to original raw data
- Generate cleaning summary reports for analysis workflow
