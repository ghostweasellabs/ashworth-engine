# ADR-005: Use OpenAI GPT-4 for Report Generation

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Ashworth Engine needs to generate high-quality, consulting-grade financial reports that provide actionable insights and strategic recommendations. The reports must be professional, accurate, and tailored to each client's business context.

## Decision
We will leverage OpenAI GPT-4 as the primary narrative engine for report generation, with fallback support for Anthropic Claude.

## Rationale
- **Quality**: GPT-4 produces the highest quality business writing and analysis
- **Context Understanding**: Excellent ability to understand financial data context
- **Professional Tone**: Can generate consulting-grade reports with appropriate language
- **Flexibility**: Can adapt writing style based on business type and audience
- **Proven Track Record**: Established performance in business document generation

## Consequences
### Positive
- High-quality, professional report output
- Consistent tone and style across reports
- Ability to generate insights beyond raw data analysis
- Scalable report generation without human writers
- Multi-language support for international clients

### Negative
- External dependency on OpenAI service
- Usage costs that scale with report volume
- Potential for hallucination in financial data
- Need for robust prompt engineering and validation
- Rate limiting and API availability concerns

## Implementation
- Configure OpenAI API integration in `src/utils/llm_integration.py`
- Implement structured prompts in `src/config/prompts.py`
- Use GPT-4 for narrative generation and insights
- Implement validation checks for numerical accuracy
- Provide Anthropic Claude as fallback option
- Monitor usage costs and implement rate limiting

## Risk Mitigation
- Implement fact-checking against original data
- Use structured prompts to minimize hallucination
- Set up monitoring for API availability and costs
- Maintain fallback to alternative LLM providers
- Implement human review workflows for critical reports
