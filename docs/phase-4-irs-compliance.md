# Phase 4: IRS Compliance Enhancement - Implementing Tax Categorization with Official IRS Guidelines

## Objective

Enhance the tax categorization capabilities of the platform by implementing strict adherence to official IRS guidelines, specifically using the current IRS Publication 334 (Tax Guide for Small Business) rather than the discontinued Publication 535. This phase ensures all tax-related functionality follows conservative, audit-defensible practices with zero tolerance for hallucinations.

## Key Technologies

- IRS Publication 334 compliance
- Context7 MCP for authoritative regulatory documentation
- LangChain for tax rule implementation
- Supabase for tax category storage
- Official IRS expense categories with codes

## Implementation Steps

### 4.1 IRS Compliance Foundation Setup

1. Integrate Context7 MCP to access current IRS publications:
   ```bash
   # Use Context7 to retrieve authoritative IRS Publication 334
   # Ensure all tax rules are based on official documentation
   ```

2. Verify the most current IRS publications before implementing tax-related features:
   - Confirm Publication 334 is the current guide for small business taxes
   - Identify the 11 official IRS expense categories with codes
   - Document Section 179 deduction limits ($2.5M limit for 2025)

### 4.2 Enhanced Tax Categorizer Agent Implementation

1. Update the Tax Categorizer Agent with official IRS expense categories:
   - Implement all 11 official IRS expense categories based on Publication 334
   - Add proper category codes for each expense type
   - Enforce the "Ordinary and Necessary" standard for all categorizations

2. Implement specific IRS rules and limitations:
   - Add 50% business meal deduction rule compliance
   - Implement Section 179 deduction optimization with $2.5M limit for 2025
   - Add Form 8300 warnings for transactions ≥$10,000
   - Implement NAICS business type detection

3. Add audit trigger detection and warnings:
   - Identify potential audit triggers in expense patterns
   - Generate warnings for high-risk categorizations
   - Implement conservative, audit-defensible language in all responses

### 4.3 System Prompt Updates for IRS Compliance

1. Update all agent system prompts to enforce strict adherence to IRS guidelines:
   ```python
   # Example system prompt enhancement
   SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
   You are a tax compliance expert with zero tolerance for hallucinations.
   All responses must be based on official IRS Publication 334.
   Use conservative, audit-defensible language in all tax advice.
   """
   ```

2. Implement validation mechanisms to prevent tax hallucinations:
   - Cross-reference all tax advice with official IRS publications
   - Add fact-checking steps for all tax-related outputs
   - Implement warning systems for uncertain tax positions

## Checkpoint 4
