# Phase 7: Launch and Enhancements - Constructing the Interactive Frontend

## Objective

Build the user interface that allows users to interact with the backend systems. Create a clean, responsive, and intuitive single-page application built with Next.js.

## Key Technologies

- Next.js for frontend application
- shadcn/ui for UI components
- React for component architecture
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Implementation Steps

### 5.1 UI Foundation with shadcn/ui

1. Initialize shadcn/ui within the apps/web Next.js project:
   ```bash
   yarn dlx shadcn@latest init
   ```

2. Configure options (style, color theme) and set up necessary files:
   - tailwind.config.js
   - components.json

3. Add required components using the CLI:
   ```bash
   yarn dlx shadcn@latest add button input card label
   ```

### 5.2 Building the Document Upload Interface

1. Create a dedicated page/section for document uploads

2. Implement React component using shadcn/ui components:
   - Input component with type="file"
   - Label component for accessibility
   - useState hook to manage selected file state

3. Implement form submission handler:
   - Use browser's Fetch API or axios
   - Construct multipart/form-data request
   - Send selected file to backend POST /upload endpoint

### 5.3 Building the Conversational Chat Interface

1. Create chat interface component with two main parts:
   - Display area for conversation history
   - Input form for new messages

2. Implement API integration and state management:
   - Asynchronous function for POST requests to /chat endpoint
   - Send current user message and conversation history for context

3. Implement streaming data handling:
   - Use Fetch API ReadableStream support
   - Implement for await...of loop to read data chunks
   - Update component state as chunks arrive
   - Trigger re-renders to append new text to AI response

## Checkpoint 7

The Ashworth Engine v2 should be feature-complete for its initial version:
- Open web application in browser
- Navigate to upload page to add financial documents to knowledge base
- Proceed to chat interface
- Ask questions about uploaded document content
- Receive AI agent responses streamed in real-time

## Success Criteria

- [ ] shadcn/ui initialized and configured properly
- [ ] Required UI components added (button, input, card, label)
- [ ] Document upload page/section implemented
- [ ] File selection interface using shadcn/ui components
- [ ] Form submission handler for backend API
- [ ] Chat interface with conversation history display
- [ ] Input form for new messages
- [ ] API integration with /chat endpoint
- [ ] Streaming data handling implemented
- [ ] Real-time response display in chat interface
- [ ] End-to-end testing successful through UI

## Future Enhancements

After completing this phase, consider these enhancements:
- Production deployment strategies
- Observability and monitoring with Langfuse
- Advanced RAG strategies (hybrid search, parent-document retrievers)
- Scalability optimizations (ANN indexes, horizontal scaling)
