# Phase 5: Financial Visualization - Adding Chart Generation Capabilities

## Objective

Implement the Chart Generator Agent to produce professional financial visualizations using Apache ECharts via pyecharts. This phase adds data visualization capabilities to enhance expense analysis and reporting, with support for both web display and PNG export for PDF report generation.

## Key Technologies

- Apache ECharts via pyecharts library
- Dr. Vivian Chen persona for Chart Generator Agent
- Professional styling and currency formatting
- Interactive features for web display
- PNG export using snapshot-selenium
- Integration with existing financial data

## Implementation Steps

### 5.1 Chart Generator Agent Implementation

1. Create the Chart Generator Agent based on Dr. Vivian Chen persona:
   ```python
   # Chart Generator Agent implementation
   class ChartGeneratorAgent:
       def __init__(self):
           # Initialize pyecharts configuration
           # Set business-appropriate themes and color schemes
           pass
       
       def generate_expense_analysis_chart(self, data):
           # Generate professional expense analysis visualizations
           pass
   ```

2. Integrate pyecharts as the standard library for financial charts:
   - Configure pyecharts with professional business themes
   - Implement currency formatting for financial data
   - Add interactive features suitable for executive presentations

### 5.2 Apache ECharts Integration

1. Set up pyecharts configuration:
   ```python
   from pyecharts import options as opts
   from pyecharts.charts import Bar, Line, Pie
   
   # Configure business-appropriate themes and color schemes
   # Set up currency formatting for financial data
   ```

2. Implement various chart types for financial visualization:
   - Bar charts for expense category comparisons
   - Line charts for expense trends over time
   - Pie charts for expense distribution analysis
   - Custom charts for tax deduction optimization visualization

### 5.3 PNG Export Capability

1. Integrate snapshot-selenium for PNG export:
   ```python
   # Implementation for exporting charts as PNG images
   from snapshot_selenium import snapshot as driver
   
   # Configure snapshot-selenium for consistent PNG generation
   # Ensure compatibility with PDF report generation pipelines
   ```

2. Implement export functionality for report integration:
   - Export charts as PNG images for PDF reports
   - Ensure consistent styling between web and print formats
   - Optimize image quality for professional presentations

## Checkpoint 5

The financial visualization capabilities should be complete and testable:
- Chart Generator Agent implemented with Dr. Vivian Chen persona
- pyecharts integrated as standard charting library
- Professional styling and currency formatting implemented
- Interactive features working for web display
- PNG export functionality using snapshot-selenium
- Integration with existing financial data pipelines
